			<h3>Recidivism</h3>
			<p>
				According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 67.8% of released state prisoners
				were arrested for a new crime within three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five years (Durose,
				Cooper, & Snyder, 2014). Reducing recidivism not only protects society at large, but also improves the
				life quality of individual ex-prisoners.
			</p>
			<p>
				Incarceration rates in the U.S. began increasing dramatically in the 1990s. The U.S. has the highest
				prison population of any country, comprising 25% of the worldâ€™s prisoners.{' '}
			</p>
			<p>Out of a sample of 401,288 prisoners state prisoners released in 2005:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>68% of released prisoners were arrested within 3 years.</li>
				<li>79% of released prisoners were arrested within 6 years.</li>
				<li>83% of released prisoners were arrested within 9 years.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using this study as a basepoint, one could state that the national recidivism rate is 83%.</p>

			<h3>Unemployment and Poverty</h3>
			<p>
				Employment has long been recognized as having a negative correlation with crime (Uggen, 1999; Uggen et
				al., 2005).

			<p>
				Researchers also have found that employment is associated with reduced recidivism(Skardhamar & Telle,
				2012). The strongest predictor for recidivism: poverty + unemployment.
